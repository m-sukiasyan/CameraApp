Here we are going to build a custom **full-screen camera application**. The app provides a minimalistic UI with a single capture button at the bottom of the screen.

_The template includes a pre-built storyboard and custom classes._

- If you open the Storyboard, you will find two view controllers. 
- The Custom Camera Controller is used to show the camera interface, while the Photo View Controller is constructed for showing a captured photo. 
- Both view controllers are associated with the corresponding class.
